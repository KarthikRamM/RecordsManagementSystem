# Records Management System
A C# console project to manage records (here teacher records are chosen to depict a use case), which are stored in a text file

This project enables performing all of the CRUD, i.e., Create, Read, Update, and Delete, operations over the records stored in the text file

The project is developed in a modular fashion, to ensure easy future updates. In order to allow faster processing and operations, efficient algorithms such as Lists operations, and Binary Search are used. Thus, allowing for better scalability to real world scenarios.

Functionalities provided:
  1.	To store new teacher data:
        1.	To store a single teacher record at a time
        2.	To store multiple teacher records at a time
  2.	To retrieve/view the existing teacher data
        1.	To retrieve a particular teacher record
        2.	To retrieve a range of teacher records
        3.	To retrieve all the teacher records
  3.	To update existing teacher data
  4.	To delete the stored teacher data
        1.	To delete a particular teacher record
        2.	To delete a range of teacher records
        3.	To delete all the teacher records

(Teacher ID is used to identify the record/s, if needed by any of the operations)
